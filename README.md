# tf-roo-test

A live coding to test for potential platform engineers.

## Requirements

* [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv)

## Setup

AWS creds need to be setup outside of this repo, a simple way is to use env vars like so:

```BASH
# File w/Access Keys
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_REGION="eu-west-1"
```

Then you can source this file before running any commands.

## Usage

A simple [Makefile](Makefile) is provided for running some common commands:

```BASH
# Run terraform plan
make tf-plan
# Run terraform apply
make tf-apply
```
